GDataXML-HTML is a HTML/XML parser for iOS and OSX, based on Google's GDataXML. As the name suggest it adds support for the HTMLparser module of libxml2 and enables you to deal with non validating XML or HTML.

So you can use e.g. XPath to parse Websites with reasonable performance

# Use in your own project #

### Install with CocoaPods

pod 'GDataXML-HTML', '~> 1.4.1'

### Manually ###

1. First add the files from the Pod/Classes folder in this project to your source tree, then include them somewhere in your code,

2. In Xcode choose the project file (in the project navigator, the top item).

3. In the list choose your project target and select 'Build Settings' at the top of the window.
Then you should see a list of build options.

4. Add this line to 'Header Search Paths' (use search bar to find the right option)
/usr/include/libxml2

# Examples #

There are usage examples inside the GDataXML_HTMLViewController.m file.
Basically the library builds an object library of the entire XML DOM. This library
adds convenient Objective-C types around the libxml parsing library.
